# 📊 Business Analytics & A/B Testing Project

## 🎯 Project Description
Comprehensive data analysis project for an online store that combines business hypothesis prioritization and statistical analysis of A/B tests. The goal is to identify revenue growth opportunities using data-driven methodologies.

## 🚀 Objectives
Part 1: Prioritize business hypotheses using ICE and RICE frameworks.

Part 2: Analyze A/B test results to validate optimization strategies.
Provide recommendations based on statistical evidence.

## 📁 Data Structure
Datasets Used
Hypothesis Prioritization:
- hypotheses_us.csv - 9 hypotheses with evaluation metrics

A/B Testing Analysis:
- orders_us.csv - Transactional order data
- visits_us.csv - Traffic data by test group

## 🔬 Methodology
#### Part 1: Hypothesis Prioritization
ICE Framework:
- Impact: Potential impact on the business
- Confidence: Level of confidence in the hypothesis
- Ease: Ease of implementation
- ICE Score = (Impact × Confidence × Ease)

RICE Framework:
- Reach: Number of users affected
- Impact: Impact per user
- Confidence: Confidence in estimates
- Effort: Effort required
- RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

#### Part 2: A/B Testing Analysis
Exploratory Analysis:
- Temporal evolution of cumulative revenue
- Analysis of average order size
- Identification of outliers and anomalies
- Calculation of conversion rates

## Statistical Analysis:
- Statistical significance tests
- Analysis with raw vs. filtered data
- Evaluation of differences between groups A and B
