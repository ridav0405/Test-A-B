# Test-A-B
A/B testing to study user interaction with the website, prioritizing hypotheses and using statistical significance tests.


The RICE and ICE framework was used to prioritize the hypothesis, and the data was transformed to make it easier to work with.
An A/B test was conducted comparing the conversion rates of both groups, order sizes, and revenue, taking into account all the data and filtering data for comparison, as well as statistical tests to visualize the significance of the data.
